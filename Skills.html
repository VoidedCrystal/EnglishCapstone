			<h1>Metacognition</h1>
			<p>When Coding you will almost always run into problems.<br> So I have metacognition in the way that i can figure out <br> what could be causing the problem and adapting the code <br> to make it work. Esports also uses this quite often. <br> In Esports the game state is always changing. This means <br> adapting on the fly to the new situation that happen on screen.</p>

			<h1>Critical Thinking</h1>
			<p>Coding requires alot of Critical Thinking because circumstances <br>change really easily. Being able to see when you should make<br> changes to what you are doing is very essential.  Most Esports <br> are a team games. Very few being one on one. As a team you <br> have to be able to make descisions about the game quickly and <br> well.</p>
