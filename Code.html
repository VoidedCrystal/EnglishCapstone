		<div><h1>Breaking down a website</h1>
		<p>Websites can be broken into 3 different Parts the HTML, the CSS and JavaScript (JS) <br>You can think of the HTML as the skeleton of a Website and the CSS as how it looks. <br> The About me page (The Homepage) of this web would look like this without css -> <br> CSS can make any page look great. There is a website called <a href="https://csszengarden.com">CSS Zen Garden.</a> <br> CSS Zen Garden is a website that shows the same website but with varying CSS Code. <br> JS is a coding language that is very versitile. It allows for the website to do more things. <br>Things like buttons that change the website but not change the page are an example. </p></div>
